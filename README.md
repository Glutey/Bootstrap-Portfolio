# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Using Bootstrap to revamp the first edition of my Live-Portfolio.

I will be utilizing, Bootstrap's NavBar, Jumbotron, Cards and some different fonts and icons.
Aim of this will be to make the portfolio look and feel better by using some more sophistacated coding elements.

Screenshot of working site:

I have been able to complete the revamp, however there are a few points that i would like to have changed but havent been able to for lack of knowledge or finding the correct method.

1. I would like to have seen a better more visually pleasing font used throughout the site.
2. Id have liked to be able to find a way to make the font colour in the NavBar white, without changing the rest of the sites font at the same time.. 
3. Id have liked to have been able to move the Menu text at the top on the NavBar all the way over to the right.
